   std::find_if()

   - Sometimes we want to see if there is a value in a container that matches some condition (e.g. a string that 
    contains a specific substring) rather than an exact value. In such cases, std::find_if is perfect.

   - The std::find_if function works similarly to std::find, but instead of passing in a specific value to 
   search for, we pass in a callable object, such as a function pointer (or a lambda, which weâ€™ll cover later). 
   For each element being iterated over, std::find_if will call this function (passing the element as an argument to the function), and the 
   function can return true if a match is found, or false otherwise.
