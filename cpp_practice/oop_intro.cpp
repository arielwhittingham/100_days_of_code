In addition to holding data, classes (and structs) 
can also contain functions! Functions defined inside 
of a class are called member functions (or sometimes methods). 
Member functions can be defined inside or outside of the class 
definition. Weâ€™ll define them inside the class for now (for simplicity), 
and show how to define them outside the class later.
